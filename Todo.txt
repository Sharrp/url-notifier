iOS App:
– Too long launch
– General:
    – short instruction on how to use the app
    – show udid

Server:
– send_url_to_device should receive array of udids (and push to all of them)
– send_url_to_device respond with status on every device
– add http:// to sended url
– Create settings.json from default copy when no settings yet

Alfred Workflow:
– Status for sended link
– Add names to devices


-- Later --
iOS App:
– Tab view: general and history
– History:
    – show opened urls in new to old order
