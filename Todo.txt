iOS App:
– Tab view: general and history
– History:
    – show opened urls in new to old order
    – seprate them by dates (today, yesterday, this week, this month, long time ago)
    – tap on the url opens url again
– General:
    – short instruction on how to use app
    – show udid

Server:
– Add url length to response for ios-client checking
– Generate more secure udids (but comfortable for human use)
– Store last url for every device to be able to resend them directly to client on demand (in case when entire url did not fit into payload)
– Implement get_last_url
– Refactor a little bit (e.g. s['udids'] should be s['tokens'])
– Create settings.json from default copy when no settings yet

Alfred Workflow:
– Add device
– Remove device
– Send link to all
– Send link to specific one
