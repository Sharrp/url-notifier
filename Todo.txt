– Too long launch
– General:
    – short instruction on how to use the app

– send_url_to_device should receive array of udids (and push to all of them)
– send_url_to_device respond with status on every device
– add http:// to sended url

Alfred Workflow:
– Send link to all (to specific if there is one only)
– Send link to specific one
